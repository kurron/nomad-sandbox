# Overview
This project is a set of [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) boxes that are configured to run 
a [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) cluster which can be used for experimentation.

# Prerequisites
* a working [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installation
* a working [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installation

# Building
This project is a collection of Vagrant files so there isn't anything to build.

# Installation
Other than the prerequisites, there is nothing to install.  Necessary files will be pulled over 
the network.

# Tips and Tricks

`vagrant up` will launch the sandbox. The first time the sandbox is launched, it will take a bit 
of time as the various pieces are downloaded and installed.
